# Dot Files

- This repo is a place holder for the my config files. I have meticuously spent
  hours configuring, just to get that one alias working, or make my vscode have
  the perfect setup for comfy coding.
- Warning these will probably not work if you just clone them. They are more so
  references. Should my computer be bricked, I have some of my work to fall back
  on, and hopefully not 'waste' as many hours, setting up my config.
- Enjoy.
